MileApp Fullstack Developer Test 
We truly value the time and effort you put into completing this assessment. The purpose of this 
technical test is to understand your approach to building a functional web application and to 
demonstrate your skills across both front-end and back-end development. 
For this assignment, you will be asked to: 
Build a Login page and a Task CRUD module (Create, Read, Update, Delete). 
Requirements: 
1. Mock API 
o Create using Framework: Gin, Laravel, or expressJS for last option.  
o Endpoints: 
ยง POST /login (return mock token). 
ยง GET /tasks (must support filter, sort, pagination, and return meta info). 
ยง POST /tasks, PUT /tasks/:id, DELETE /tasks/:id. 
ยง Create a detailed, production-ready REST API (spec, implementation, and 
tests) that includes proper status codes, error handling, input validation, 
and unit tests. 
2. Frontend 
o Use Vue.js. 
o Login page with mock auth flow (token-based). 
o Task module with full CRUD and protected routes. 
o Clean and responsive UI/UX. 
3. MongoDB Index Script 
o Provide a file db/indexes.js with MongoDB index creation commands based on 
your query needs. 
4. Deployment 
o Deploy both frontend and API (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Render, Railway). 
o Share live URLs and repository Code link. 
5. readme.md 
o Explain what you built, your design decisions, and the strengths of your module. 
o Include why you chose the database indexes you created.
